## Responsibilities

* Programming the entire game, which includes:
	1. Implementing the "slots" of the cash register and corresponding them with the player's input to create change.
	2. Creating a dynamic dialogue system for character interaction and the tutorial that can be interrupted by game events.
	3. Calculating among many variables to represent the "mood" of the manager, main character, and customers as the game progresses.
* Designing the game's difficulty curve.
* Drawing all of the pixel art for the UI.
* Writing the entire tutorial.
* Creating all of the sound effects.

## Development
***

Development of Cashier Guy began on July 13th as a game for [My First Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2020) with the theme of Change. For a two week jam, the game was scoped to be small from the beginning, with completion being the goal. Godot was used as the game engine of choice due to personal preference when it came to 2D games. Cashier Guy was completed and submitted within the required deadline on July 25th.
