Slime Volleyball is a clone of the browser game of the same name, and is a local multiplayer volleyball game. I made two versions; first with Unity, and the other with Godot, with the purpose of learning the game engines.

## Responsibilities
***

* Programming the entirety of both games, which includes:
	1. Implementing a new spiking mechanic where players can hit the ball with the very front of their slime to send the ball downwards at a faster speed.
	2. Utilizing an event-based system to broadcast the game's state.
	3. In the Unity version, adding several UI options for customization of how the game plays.

## Development
***

Development of Slime Volleyball began with the Unity version first on January 10th, 2020, and was completed on January 21st, 2020. The Godot version's development began on February 10th, 2020, and was mostly completed February 21st, with additional edits made on March 19th, 2020.
